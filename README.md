# üìä Optimizing Workforce Strategy through HR Data Insights

## üßæ Project Overview

The HR department seeks to understand workforce distribution, employee engagement, and performance across departments, work locations, and age groups. However, with diverse employment types, variable skill levels, and performance inconsistencies, it becomes challenging to identify trends, optimize talent allocation, and improve retention.

This HR dashboard was developed to analyze key metrics such as employee demographics, skills, performance ratings, leave patterns, and salaries, with the goal of supporting strategic decision-making and improving human capital management.
